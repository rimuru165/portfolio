        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Janno E, Into and Im 20 years old and I live in San Vicente Makilala and work at Into Automotive Spare Parts Shop, where we sell motorcycle and chainsaw parts. We also repair motorcycles and chainsaws. Our shop is located in an area with many small businesses, including my father's company, which cuts and transports wood. The shop is on the side of the main street to San Vicente, near Purok 3 and Purok 20.

        <h2>My Hobby</h2>
        <p>
          My hobbies include online gaming and reading novels. One of the games I play is Genshin Impact, an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. It was released for various platforms including Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows in 2020, and for PlayStation 5 in 2021. The game features an anime-style open-world environment with an action-based battle system.

          Another game I enjoy is Honkai: Star Rail, miHoYo's first turn-based game. It features the Trailblazer, who travels across worlds via the Astral Express to connect worlds and resolve disasters caused by Stellarons and other threats.

        <h2>Interest</h2>
        <p>
          My interest lies in the family business that my parents started. I've been actively helping to manage the shop and plan to take over the business after graduation. I also plan to open an internet cafe next to the shop.
